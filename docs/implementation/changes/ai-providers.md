# üìù Change Summary: Multiple AI Providers Integration

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of multiple AI providers in the Reportly application, starting with OpenRouter integration alongside the existing OpenAI implementation. This enhancement provides access to a wider range of AI models and improves the reliability and cost-effectiveness of AI features.

## üîÑ Changes Made

### 1. Created Unified AI Client Interface

Created a new unified AI client interface that abstracts away provider-specific details:

**File**: `src/lib/ai/providers/aiClient.ts`

```typescript
export async function callAI({
  prompt,
  systemPrompt = "",
  temperature = 0.7,
  model = "gpt-4",
  maxTokens
}: AICallOptions): Promise<AIResponse> {
  // Provider selection based on environment variable
  switch (PROVIDER) {
    case "openai":
      return await callOpenAI(messages, temperature, model, maxTokens);
    case "openrouter":
      return await callOpenRouter(messages, temperature, model, maxTokens);
    default:
      throw new Error(`Unsupported AI provider: ${PROVIDER}`);
  }
}
```

### 2. Implemented Model Configuration and Selection

Created a comprehensive model configuration and selection system:

**Files**:
- `src/lib/ai/providers/modelConfig.ts`
- `src/lib/ai/providers/modelSelector.ts`

Key features:
- Model mapping between providers
- Model metadata (tokens, costs)
- Task-specific model selection
- Quality-based selection
- Cost-sensitive selection

### 3. Updated Environment Variables

Added new environment variables for AI provider configuration:

**File**: `.env.example`

```
# AI Provider Configuration
AI_PROVIDER=openai  # Options: openai, openrouter
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key
APP_URL=https://your-app-url.com  # Required for OpenRouter

# Model-Specific Configuration
AI_SUMMARY_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo  # Model for summarization
AI_CATEGORY_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo  # Model for categorization
AI_ENHANCEMENT_MODEL=gpt-4  # Model for text enhancement
AI_SUGGESTION_MODEL=gpt-4  # Model for suggestions
```

### 4. Refactored Existing AI Features

Updated all existing AI features to use the unified AI client:

**Files**:
- `src/lib/ai/passive/generateSummary.js`
- `src/lib/ai/passive/categorizeReport.js`
- `src/lib/ai/active/enhanceText.js`
- `src/lib/ai/active/aiAssistInEditor.js`
- `src/lib/ai/active/fetchSuggestions.ts`

Changes:
- Replaced direct OpenAI calls with the unified interface
- Added model selection based on task
- Improved error handling
- Added metadata tracking

### 5. Created Tests and Documentation

Added comprehensive tests and documentation:

**Files**:
- `tests/unit/ai-providers.test.js`
- `tests/integration/ai-providers.test.js`
- `docs/specifications/ai/ai-providers.md`
- `docs/specifications/ai/openrouter-integration.md`
- `docs/testing/manual-tests/editor/ai-providers-test.md`
- `docs/milestones/m9-ai-providers.md`
- `docs/implementation/changes/ai-providers.md`

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Tests

- Test provider selection based on environment variables
- Test model mapping between providers
- Test error handling for various scenarios

### Integration Tests

- Test each AI feature with both providers
- Test switching between providers
- Test with various model configurations

### Manual Tests

- Comprehensive manual test script for QA
- Performance comparison between providers
- Cost comparison between providers

## üöÄ Impact

### User Experience

- Access to a wider range of AI models
- Potentially improved response quality
- No visible changes to the UI or workflow

### Performance

- Potential for improved response times with certain models
- Ability to choose models based on performance requirements

### Cost

- Potential for reduced costs with certain models
- Ability to choose models based on cost sensitivity

## üìã Future Work

- Add support for additional AI providers (e.g., Anthropic, Cohere)
- Implement automatic fallback between providers
- Create a provider performance comparison dashboard
- Implement cost optimization strategies
