# Organization & Workspace System - Changes Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to implement the multi-tenant architecture with Organizations and Workspaces in the Reportly application. This architecture allows users to belong to organizations and work within specific workspaces, with data scoped to those workspaces.

## Data Models

### Updated Models

1. **Report Model** (`src/models/Report.ts`)
   - Added `workspaceId` and `organizationId` fields
   - Added compound indexes for efficient queries
   - Maintained backward compatibility with `groupId` for migration purposes

2. **Comment Model** (`src/models/Comment.ts`)
   - Added `workspaceId` and `organizationId` fields
   - Added compound indexes for efficient queries

3. **User Model** (existing)
   - Already had `organizationId`, `workspaceIds`, and `activeWorkspaceId` fields

### New Models

1. **Organization Model** (`src/models/Organization.ts`)
   - Represents an organization in the multi-tenant architecture
   - Contains name and owner information

2. **Workspace Model** (`src/models/Workspace.ts`)
   - Represents a workspace within an organization
   - Contains name, type, and member information

## Server Actions

### Organization Actions

1. **getOrganization** (`src/app/actions/organization/getOrganization.ts`)
   - Retrieves the current user's organization details

2. **updateOrganization** (`src/app/actions/organization/updateOrganization.ts`)

   - Enforces ownership validation

3. **createOrganization** (`src/app/actions/organization/createOrganization.ts`)
   - Creates a new organization for a user
   - Creates a default workspace within the organization

### Workspace Actions

1. **getUserWorkspaces** (`src/app/actions/workspace/getUserWorkspaces.ts`)
   - Retrieves all workspaces for the current user

2. **setActiveWorkspace** (`src/app/actions/workspace/setActiveWorkspace.ts`)
   - Sets the active workspace for the current user

3. **createWorkspace** (`src/app/actions/workspace/createWorkspace.ts`)
   - Creates a new workspace within the user's organization

4. **updateWorkspace** (`src/app/actions/workspace/updateWorkspace.ts`)
   - Updates a workspace's name and type
   - Enforces access control

5. **deleteWorkspace** (`src/app/actions/workspace/deleteWorkspace.ts`)
   - Deletes a workspace and all associated data
   - Enforces access control and prevents deletion of active workspace

### Report Actions

1. **getReportsByWorkspace** (`src/app/actions/report/getReportsByWorkspace.ts`)
   - Retrieves all reports for a specific workspace
   - Enforces workspace access control

2. **getReportsByUser** (`src/app/actions/report/getReportsByUser.ts`)
   - Updated to use the active workspace

## UI Components

1. **WorkspaceContext** (`src/contexts/WorkspaceContext.tsx`)
   - Manages workspace state across the application
   - Provides active workspace information and workspace switching functionality

2. **WorkspaceSwitcher** (`src/components/workspace/WorkspaceSwitcher.tsx`)
   - UI component for switching between workspaces
   - Displays in the navbar

3. **Settings Pages**
   - **Workspace Management** (`src/app/settings/workspaces/page.tsx`)
     - UI for creating, updating, and deleting workspaces
   - **Organization Settings** (`src/app/settings/organization/page.tsx`)
     - UI for viewing and updating organization details
   - **Settings Layout** (`src/app/settings/layout.tsx`)
     - Common layout for all settings pages

## Access Control

1. **Workspace Access Control** (`src/lib/rbac/workspaceAccess.ts`)
   - Utilities for checking and enforcing workspace access
   - Prevents unauthorized access to workspace data

## Migration

1. **Migration Script** (`scripts/migrate-to-orgs.ts`)
   - Migrates existing data to the new multi-tenant architecture
   - Creates default organizations and workspaces for existing users
   - Updates reports and comments with workspace and organization IDs

## Testing

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Tests for workspace access control utilities
   - Tests for WorkspaceContext and WorkspaceSwitcher
   - Tests for organization and workspace server actions

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Tests for the workspace management page

## Next Steps

1. **Run Migration**
   - Execute the migration script to update existing data

2. **Update Other Components**
   - Update report creation and editing to use workspaces
   - Update comment creation to use workspaces

3. **Add More Features**
   - Implement workspace member management
   - Implement workspace-specific permissions
   - Add workspace analytics

## Conclusion

The Organization & Workspace system provides a solid foundation for multi-tenant functionality in the Reportly application. It allows users to organize their work in separate workspaces while maintaining data isolation and security.
