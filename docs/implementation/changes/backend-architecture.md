## Expand Passive AI Pipeline

### Changes Made
- **Created** `lib/utils/logger.js`: A simple placeholder logger with `log` and `error` functions.
- **Created** `lib/ai/passive/categorizeReport.js`: A placeholder function for the categorization AI task.
- **Modified** `app/report/actions/saveReport.js`:
    - Imports `categorizeReport` and `logger`.
    - Calls `generateSummary` first, followed by `categorizeReport`, passing the content and the generated summary (if available).
    - Logs key steps and errors throughout the process.
    - Saves both `ai_summary` and `ai_tags` to the `Report` model.
    - Includes basic error handling for the AI steps (logs errors but attempts to proceed).

### Summary
The `saveReport` server action was successfully updated to chain the `generateSummary` and `categorizeReport` passive AI functions. It now includes error handling for each AI step and utilizes the newly created `logger.js` utility for logging. The placeholder `categorizeReport.js` function is also in place.

## Centralized Logging for AI Interactions

### Changes Made
- **`lib/utils/logger.js`**: The centralized logger exists and meets the requirements.
- **`lib/ai/passive/generateSummary.js`**: Updated to use `logger.log` and `logger.error`.
- **`lib/ai/passive/categorizeReport.js`**: Updated to use `logger.log` and `logger.error`.
- **`app/report/actions/saveReport.js`**: Already updated in the prior step to use `logger.log` and `logger.error` consistently.

### Summary
Implemented the centralized logging utility in `lib/utils/logger.js` and updated the AI helper functions (`generateSummary.js`, `categorizeReport.js`) and the server action (`saveReport.js`) to use it for logging function starts, ends, and errors, replacing previous `console` calls.

## Basic Server Actions for CRUD Operations

### Actions Created
- **`app/report/actions/getReports.js`**: Fetches all reports, sorted by creation date.
- **`app/report/actions/updateReport.js`**: Updates specified fields of a report by its ID. Note: This action does not trigger the passive AI pipeline; `saveReport.js` should be used for updates requiring AI processing.
- **`app/report/actions/deleteReport.js`**: Deletes a report by its ID.

### Summary
Created the requested server actions for basic Report CRUD operations: `getReports.js`, `updateReport.js`, and `deleteReport.js` within the `app/report/actions/` directory. These actions handle fetching, updating, and deleting reports, include validation, use the centralized logger for error reporting, and revalidate relevant Next.js paths.

## Unit Tests for Key Functions

### Tests Added
- **`tests/unit/lib/ai/passive/generateSummary.test.js`**: Tests the AI summary function, mocking the logger and handling valid/invalid input scenarios.
- **`tests/unit/lib/db/connectDB.test.js`**: Tests the database connection utility, mocking Mongoose and `console` to verify connection logic, including success, reuse, missing URI, and failure cases.
- **`tests/unit/app/report/actions/saveReport.test.js`**: Tests the report saving action, mocking database connection, the `Report` model, AI helper functions, logger, and `revalidatePath`. It covers creating and updating reports, handling missing input, AI failures, and database errors.

### Summary
Created Jest unit tests for `generateSummary.js`, `connectDB.js`, and `saveReport.js`. The tests are located in the `tests/unit/` directory, following the specified structure.

## Editor AI Suggestions System

### Components Added
- **`lib/ai/active/aiAssistInEditor.js`**: Contains the `suggestImprovements` mock implementation.
- **`hooks/useAiAssist.ts`**: A React hook for managing suggestion state and fetching.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: Configures TypeScript and path aliases.
- Installed `@types/react` to resolve React type declaration issues.
