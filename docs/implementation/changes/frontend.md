## 4. AI Suggestion Panel
- **Features:**
    - Scaffolding for the AI Suggestion Panel feature is complete.
    - **Created/Modified Files:**
        - `src/lib/ai/active/enhanceText.js`: Mock function simulating AI text enhancement (placeholder for future use).
        - `src/app/report/actions/generateSuggestions.ts`: Server action simulating fetching AI suggestions (returns mock data).
        - `src/components/AiSuggestionPanel.tsx`: UI component responsible for:
            - Fetching suggestions via the server action.
            - Displaying suggestions.
            - Handling loading/error states.
            - Providing Accept/Dismiss actions.
        - `src/components/report/ReportPageContainer.tsx`: Modified to:
            - Include the `AiSuggestionPanel`.
            - Manage its visibility.
            - Pass the editor content as `targetText` for triggering suggestions.
            - Include a placeholder `handleAcceptSuggestion` callback.
- **Next Steps:**  
    ### Automatic AI Suggestion Triggering Logic

    The automatic AI suggestion triggering logic has been implemented in `ReportPageContainer.tsx`.

    - **Refactoring AiSuggestionPanel:**
        - The `AiSuggestionPanel` component was refactored to accept suggestion state and callbacks as props.

    - **State Management:**
        - `ReportPageContainer` now manages the state for AI suggestions, including:
            - `data`: The fetched suggestions.
            - `loading`: The loading state.
            - `error`: Any errors encountered during fetching.
            - `visibility`: Whether the suggestion panel is visible.

    - **Debounced Suggestion Fetching:**
        - A `useEffect` hook listens to updates in the TipTap editor.
        - A 3-second debounce timer is used to call the `generateSuggestions` server action with the current editor content.

    - **Callback Integration:**
        - The necessary state and callbacks (`onAcceptSuggestion`, `onDismissSuggestion`, `onRegenerate`) are passed to the `AiSuggestionPanel`.
        - This setup ensures that suggestions are automatically fetched when the user pauses typing in the editor.

    - **Status:** The triggering logic is functional and ready for further testing and refinement.

    ## 5. Dashboard / Report List View
    - **Features:**
        - Implemented the Dashboard / Report List View feature based on the provided specifications.
        - **Created/Modified Files:**
            - `src/lib/mockData.ts`: Created mock data structures and generation functions.
            - `src/components/dashboard/ActivityStats.tsx`: Displays activity statistics.
            - `src/components/dashboard/WeeklyActivityHeatmap.tsx`: Visualizes weekly activity in a heatmap.
            - `src/components/dashboard/ReportListItem.tsx`: Represents individual report items.
            - `src/components/dashboard/ReportList.tsx`: Displays a list of reports with "Show More" functionality (using mock data).
            - `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`: Assembled the dashboard components into the main dashboard page.
        - Added a Floating Action Button (FAB) to navigate to the new report creation page.
    - **Status:** The dashboard is scaffolded with mock data and ready for backend integration.

    ## 6. Backend Server Actions
    - **Updates:**
        - Refactored existing server actions (`saveReport`, `updateReport`, `deleteReport`, `getReports`) to TypeScript.
        - Added Zod validation for input data in all server actions.
        - Implemented missing actions:
            - `duplicateReport`: Duplicates an existing report.
            - `getReportsByUser`: Fetches reports specific to a user.
        - Shared Zod schemas for report actions are defined in `src/lib/schemas/reportSchemas.ts`.
    - **Status:** All required server actions are implemented and validated.

    ## 7. Dashboard / Report List View Enhancements
    - **Features:**
        - Added action buttons to `ReportListItem.tsx`:
            - **Delete:** Deletes a report with confirmation.
            - **Duplicate:** Duplicates a report.
            - **Pin (mock):** Placeholder for pinning functionality.
            - **Share (mock):** Placeholder for sharing functionality.
        - Integrated handlers in `ReportListItem.tsx` to call server actions or mock functions:
            - Displays toast notifications for user feedback.
        - Implemented a confirmation modal for the delete action.
        - Updated `ReportList.tsx` to:
            - Manage the state of reports.
            - Handle updates via callbacks (`onDelete`, `onDuplicate`) passed to `ReportListItem`.
            - Ensure the UI reflects changes after actions are performed.
    - **Status:** Fully functional with mock and real actions, ready for further testing and refinement.

    ## 8. New Report functionality
    I have implemented the "New Report" functionality.

A client component NewReportButton.tsx was created to handle the report creation logic.
It calls the saveReport server action with default values ("Untitled Report", empty content) upon clicking.
It provides loading state and toast notifications using react-hot-toast.
Upon successful creation, it redirects the user to the new report's editor page (/report/[id]?edit=true) using next/navigation.
The dashboard page (src/app/dashboard/page.tsx) now uses this button component.
