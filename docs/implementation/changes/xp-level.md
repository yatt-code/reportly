# XP and Level System Changes Summary

## Database Schema Implementation

The XP and level system has been implemented with a Supabase table called `user_stats` with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_stats (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  xp INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  level INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  last_updated TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

Row Level Security (RLS) policies have been implemented to:
- Allow users to view their own stats
- Allow users to update their own stats
- Restrict INSERT operations to backend-only (system privileges)

## Core Utilities

The following core utilities have been implemented:

1. **XP Rules Configuration** (`src/lib/xp/xpRules.ts`):
   - Defines XP gain values for different user actions
   - Implements a logarithmic level curve for balanced progression
   - Provides utility functions for level calculations

2. **XP Management Utility** (`src/lib/xp/addXp.ts`):
   - Adds XP to users for specific actions
   - Calculates level-ups based on the XP curve
   - Integrates with the achievement system
   - Uses Supabase service role client for secure database operations

3. **User Stats Server Action** (`src/app/actions/user/getUserStats.ts`):
   - Fetches a user's XP and level stats from Supabase
   - Respects RLS policies using the standard client
   - Returns default values for new users

## UI Components

The following UI components have been implemented:

1. **LevelBadge** (`src/components/xp/LevelBadge.tsx`):
   - Displays the user's current level as a badge
   - Customizable with optional icon

2. **XpProgressBar** (`src/components/xp/XpProgressBar.tsx`):
   - Shows progress towards the next level
   - Calculates required XP based on the level curve

3. **LevelUpToast** (`src/components/xp/LevelUpToast.tsx`):
   - Displays a celebratory notification when a user levels up

4. **XpGainToast** (`src/components/xp/XpGainToast.tsx`):
   - Shows a notification when a user gains XP

5. **UserStatsPanel** (`src/components/xp/UserStatsPanel.tsx`):
   - Dashboard widget with XP, level, and achievements summary

## Integration Points

The XP system has been integrated at the following points:

1. **Comment Creation** (`src/app/actions/comment/postComment.ts`):
   - Adds XP when a user posts a comment
   - Returns XP gain and level-up information to the client

2. **Report Creation** (`src/app/report/actions/saveReport.ts`):
   - Adds XP when a user creates a report
   - Returns XP gain and level-up information to the client

## Client-Side Integration

1. **React Hook** (`src/hooks/useUserStats.ts`):
   - Fetches and manages user stats in client components
   - Provides loading and error states
   - Includes a refetch function for updating stats

## Migration and Setup

1. **SQL Migration** (`migrations/user_stats_table.sql`):
   - Creates the user_stats table
   - Sets up RLS policies

2. **Migration Script** (`scripts/run-migration.js`):
   - Runs SQL migrations against Supabase
   - Uses the service role key for privileged operations

3. **NPM Script**:
   - Added `migrate` script to package.json for easy execution

## Testing

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Tests for XP rules and calculations (`tests/unit/lib/xp/xpRules.test.ts`)
   - Tests for the addXp utility (`tests/unit/lib/xp/addXp.test.ts`)

## Documentation

1. **README** (`src/lib/xp/README.md`):
   - Documents the XP system architecture
   - Explains integration points and usage

This implementation provides a robust foundation for tracking user engagement through XP and levels, with seamless integration into the existing achievement system.
