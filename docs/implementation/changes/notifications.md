# Notification System Changes Summary

## Supabase Schema and Security Setup

### Backend Logic Implementation

The backend logic for notifications has been successfully implemented:

1. **postComment.ts**: Extended to use the Supabase service role client for inserting new notifications into the `notifications` table when a user is mentioned (excluding self-mentions).

2. **getNotifications.ts**: New server action created to fetch unseen notifications for the authenticated user. It joins basic comment and report details, using the standard server client to respect Row Level Security (RLS).

3. **markNotificationAsSeen.ts**: New server action implemented to update the 'seen' status of specific notifications for the authenticated user. It uses the standard server client, relying on RLS and an explicit userId check for security.

These implementations complete the backend functionality for creating, fetching, and updating notifications, providing a solid foundation for the mention notification system.

## Server-side actions
All backend server actions for the notification system are now implemented according to the spec.

Task Completed:
I have implemented the backend server actions for the notification system as specified:

1. **postComment.ts**: Verified that the action correctly uses the Supabase service role client to insert notifications into the notifications table for mentioned users (excluding self-mentions) after a comment is successfully saved.

2. **getNotifications.ts**: Verified that this action fetches unseen notifications (seen: false) for the authenticated user, correctly joins related comment/report data (assuming FKs are set up), and sorts them by creation date descending.

3. **markNotificationAsSeen.ts**: Verified that this action updates the seen status of a specific notification to true, ensuring the operation is scoped to the authenticated user via an explicit .eq('userId', user.id) check in addition to RLS policies.

## Notification UI Components
The frontend components for the notification UI have been successfully implemented:

1. **NotificationBadge.tsx**: A reusable component that displays a count badge, automatically hiding when the count is zero.

2. **NotificationItem.tsx**: Renders individual notifications, showing the type (currently 'mention'), context (report title, comment snippet), and timestamp. It handles click events to mark notifications as seen and navigate to the relevant report.

3. **NotificationDropdown.tsx**: 
   - Manages the dropdown's open/close state, including closing on outside clicks.
   - Fetches unseen notifications using getNotifications on component mount.
   - Handles loading and error states for data fetching.
   - Renders the notification list using NotificationItem components.
   - Incorporates NotificationBadge on the trigger button to show unseen notification count.
   - Provides handleMarkAsSeen callback to NotificationItem, calling markNotificationAsSeen and updating the UI optimistically.

These components form a comprehensive UI for users to view and interact with their notifications. The next step is to integrate NotificationDropdown into the main application layout, such as the header.

Task Completed:
The frontend UI components for the notification system have been implemented as specified:
- Created NotificationBadge.tsx for displaying unread notification counts.
- Developed NotificationItem.tsx to render individual notifications and handle interactions.
- Implemented NotificationDropdown.tsx to fetch and display notifications, manage dropdown state, and handle notification interactions.

These components collectively provide an intuitive interface for users to view and manage their notifications effectively.

## Global Notifications State Management
The global notification context setup is complete:

### NotificationContext.tsx
- Created the context provider which:
  - Fetches unseen notifications using getNotifications periodically (every 30 seconds by default) but only when the user is authenticated (using useAuth).
  - Manages the global state for notifications, unreadCount, isLoading, and error.
  - Provides markAsSeen and refetchNotifications functions to consumers.
  - Includes the useNotifications hook for easy consumption.

### layout.tsx
- Wrapped the application's children with <NotificationProvider> (inside <AuthProvider>) to make the context available globally.

### NotificationDropdown.tsx
- Refactored to:
  - Consume notification state (notifications, unreadCount, isLoading, error) directly from the useNotifications hook.
  - Remove internal state management and data fetching logic.
  - Call the markAsSeen function provided by the context when a notification item is clicked.

This establishes a centralized system for managing notification state, reducing redundant fetching in individual components and enabling features like a persistent notification badge.

Task Completed:
The global Notification Context has been implemented:

1. Created NotificationProvider in src/contexts/NotificationContext.tsx which:
   - Fetches unseen notifications periodically using polling (when authenticated)
   - Manages the global notification state (notifications, unreadCount, isLoading, error)
   - Provides markAsSeen and refetchNotifications functions
2. Created the useNotifications hook for consuming the context
3. Wrapped the root layout (src/app/layout.tsx) with NotificationProvider
4. Refactored NotificationDropdown.tsx to consume notification state and functions from the useNotifications hook, removing its internal fetching logic

This implementation provides centralized state management for notifications across the application, improving efficiency and enabling consistent notification handling throughout the user interface.

## Security Enhancements

Verification complete: The notification insertion logic within postComment.ts correctly uses the supabaseService client (initialized with the service role key, line 141). This is necessary to bypass the RLS policy that prevents direct inserts by users, ensuring notifications can be created reliably from the server action. It also correctly filters out self-mentions (line 143).

All server actions related to notifications (getNotifications, markNotificationAsSeen, and the insertion part of postComment) now have the appropriate authentication and scoping checks implemented.

Task Completed
I have verified and confirmed that the notification-related server actions implement the required security enhancements:

1. getNotifications.ts: Fetches notifications scoped to the authenticated user using supabase.auth.getUser() and an explicit .eq('userId', user.id) filter.
2. markNotificationAsSeen.ts: Updates notifications scoped to the authenticated user using supabase.auth.getUser() and an explicit .eq('userId', user.id) filter in the update query.
3. postComment.ts (Notification Insertion): Correctly uses the Supabase service role client (getSupabaseServiceRoleClient) to insert notifications, bypassing RLS as required for server-side creation, and filters out self-mentions. The backend logic adheres to the specified access control requirements.

## Optional Enhancements

The optional enhancements for the notification system have been successfully addressed:

1. **Test Coverage**: Basic unit tests for getNotifications.ts have been implemented, effectively mocking Supabase dependencies to ensure reliable functionality.

2. **Loading Skeleton**: A new NotificationSkeleton.tsx component has been created and integrated into NotificationDropdown.tsx. This provides visual feedback during the initial notification load, enhancing the user experience.

3. **Prefetching**: After careful consideration, we have decided to maintain the current polling mechanism in NotificationContext.tsx for this iteration. This approach meets the basic requirements while keeping the implementation simple. Prefetching or real-time subscriptions remain as potential future enhancements, as outlined in the mini-spec.

Rationale for Prefetching Decision:
The current polling mechanism in NotificationContext.tsx satisfies our immediate needs. While prefetching or real-time subscriptions could offer performance benefits, they also introduce additional complexity. For this phase, we prioritize stability and simplicity, leaving room for these advanced features in future iterations.

These enhancements further refine our notification system, improving its testability, user interface, and setting a clear path for future optimizations.
