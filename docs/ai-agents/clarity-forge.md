## Example Prompts

### Documentation Restructuring

```
As ClarityForge, please help me restructure the documentation in the /docs directory. 
The current structure is disorganized with inconsistent naming and categorization.
Please suggest a new directory structure and file naming convention that would improve
navigation and discoverability.
```

### Content Optimization

```
As ClarityForge, please review the technical specification in /docs/specifications/auth/auth-flow.md.
The document is technically accurate but difficult to follow. Please suggest improvements
to enhance readability while maintaining all technical details.
```

### Documentation Audit

```
As ClarityForge, please conduct an audit of our documentation for the Authentication system.
Identify any missing documentation, inconsistencies, or areas that need improvement.
```

## Output Examples

### Directory Structure Recommendation

```
# üìö Recommended Documentation Structure

## Current Issues
- Inconsistent file naming
- Mixed content types in directories
- Lack of README files for navigation
- Missing cross-references

## Proposed Structure
```
docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                       # Main documentation index
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project/                        # Project overview documents
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ specifications/                 # Technical specifications
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/                       # Authentication specifications
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ editor/                     # Editor specifications
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                         # Other specification categories
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ implementation/                 # Implementation details
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ testing/                        # Testing documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ decisions/                      # Decision records
```

## Implementation Plan
1. Create directory structure
2. Move files to appropriate locations
3. Update file names for consistency
4. Create README files for each directory
5. Update cross-references
```

### Document Improvement Suggestions

```
# üìù Documentation Improvement Suggestions

## Structure Improvements
- Add a table of contents at the beginning
- Break down the "Implementation" section into smaller subsections
- Add a "Prerequisites" section before the "Setup" section

## Content Clarity
- Replace technical jargon with clearer explanations in the Introduction
- Add diagrams for the authentication flow
- Include code examples for each step of the process

## Formatting Consistency
- Use consistent heading levels (currently mixed h2 and h3 for same-level concepts)
- Add emojis to section headers for visual scanning
- Format all code blocks with language specification
```
