  const [suggestions, setSuggestions] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [selectedCategory, setSelectedCategory] = useState('all');
  
  // Request suggestions when content changes (debounced)
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!editor) return;
    
    const timer = setTimeout(async () => {
      const content = editor.getHTML();
      if (content.length < 50) return; // Only suggest for substantial content
      
      setLoading(true);
      const result = await getAISuggestions(content);
      setSuggestions(result.suggestions);

                    <span>{suggestion.preview}</span>
                  </div>
                )}
              </li>
            ))}
        </ul>
      ) : (
        <p className="text-gray-500 text-sm py-4">
          No suggestions available. Keep writing and suggestions will appear here.
        </p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### 2. Server Action

```tsx
// src/app/actions/ai/getAISuggestions.ts
import { OpenAI } from 'openai';
import { getCurrentUser } from '@/lib/auth';
import logger from '@/lib/utils/logger';

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

export async function getAISuggestions(content: string) {
  try {
    const user = await getCurrentUser();
    if (!user) {
      return { success: false, error: 'Authentication required' };
    }
    
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'gpt-4',
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'system',
          content: `You are an AI writing assistant that helps users improve their reports.
          Analyze the provided text and suggest improvements in these categories:
          
          1. Clarity: Identify unclear sentences or paragraphs and suggest clearer alternatives
          2. Tone: Suggest improvements to maintain a professional tone
          3. Grammar: Identify and correct grammatical errors
          4. Expansion: Suggest additional points or details that could enhance the report
          
          For each suggestion, provide:
          - Category (clarity, tone, grammar, or expansion)
          - Description of the issue or improvement
          - Specific text to replace or insert
          - Range information (for replacements)
          
          Limit your response to 3-5 high-value suggestions.`
        },
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: content
        }
      ],
      temperature: 0.7,
      response_format: { type: 'json_object' }
    });
    
    const suggestions = JSON.parse(response.choices[0].message.content);
    
    return {
      success: true,
      suggestions: suggestions.suggestions
    };
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Error getting AI suggestions:', error);
    return {
      success: false,
      error: 'Failed to generate suggestions'
    };
  }
}
```

### 3. Integration with Editor

```tsx
// src/components/editor/ReportEditor.tsx
import { AISuggestionPanel } from './AISuggestionPanel';

export const ReportEditor = () => {
  const editor = useEditor({
    // Editor configuration
  });
  
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
      <div className="col-span-2">
        {/* Editor component */}
        <EditorContent editor={editor} />
      </div>
      <div className="col-span-1">
        {/* AI Suggestion Panel */}
        <AISuggestionPanel editor={editor} />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Prompt Engineering

The system prompt is designed to:
1. Define the AI's role clearly
2. Specify the categories of suggestions
3. Structure the expected output format
4. Limit the number of suggestions to avoid overwhelming the user

## Performance Considerations

1. **Debouncing**: Implement 1-second debounce to avoid excessive API calls
2. **Minimum Content**: Only trigger suggestions when content length > 50 characters
3. **Caching**: Cache suggestions for similar content to reduce API costs
4. **Streaming**: Consider implementing streaming for faster initial suggestions

## User Experience

1. **Non-intrusive**: Suggestions appear in a side panel, not interrupting writing flow
2. **Categorized**: Suggestions are organized by type for easy filtering
3. **Preview**: Users can see how suggestions will change their text
4. **One-click Apply**: Simple interaction to apply suggestions
```

### Prompt Engineering for Summarization

```
# ðŸ§  Report Summarization Prompt Engineering

## Objective
Create effective prompts for generating concise (1-2 sentence) summaries of reports that capture key points while maintaining a professional tone.

## System Prompt

```
You are an expert summarization assistant for a professional report management system. Your task is to create a concise 1-2 sentence summary of the provided report content.

Guidelines:
1. Focus on the main topic and key findings/conclusions
2. Use professional, clear language
3. Maintain an objective tone
4. Avoid unnecessary details or examples
5. Keep the summary between 15-30 words
6. Do not use phrases like "this report" or "the author"
7. Use present tense for findings and conclusions

The summary should allow a busy professional to quickly understand what the report is about without reading the full content.
```

## Example Inputs and Outputs

### Example 1: Project Status Report

**Input:**
```
Project Alpha Phase 2 Implementation Status

The team has completed 85% of the planned deliverables for Phase 2 of Project Alpha. Key accomplishments include the deployment of the new customer portal, integration with the payment gateway, and completion of security audits. However, we are experiencing delays in the data migration component due to unexpected complexity in legacy data structures. This has pushed our timeline back by approximately two weeks.

Resource allocation remains within budget, with a 5% contingency still available. The client has been informed of the timeline adjustment and has approved the revised delivery date of March 15th.

Next steps include completing the data migration, conducting user acceptance testing, and preparing training materials for the client's staff.
```

**Output:**
```
Project Alpha Phase 2 is 85% complete with portal deployment and security audits finished, though data migration delays have extended the timeline by two weeks to March 15th.
```

### Example 2: Research Findings

**Input:**
```
Analysis of Customer Churn Factors in SaaS Businesses

Our research analyzed data from 150 SaaS companies to identify key factors contributing to customer churn. The findings indicate that the primary drivers of churn are poor onboarding experiences (42%), lack of perceived value after 30 days (38%), and inadequate customer support (27%).

Companies that implemented structured onboarding programs saw a 25% reduction in 90-day churn rates compared to those without such programs. Additionally, businesses that established regular check-in points during the first 60 days retained 30% more customers than those that did not.

The data suggests that investment in early customer experience has a higher ROI for retention than later-stage loyalty programs or discount strategies.
```

**Output:**
```
Poor onboarding experiences, lack of perceived value, and inadequate support are the main drivers of SaaS customer churn, with structured onboarding programs reducing churn by 25%.
```

## Optimization Strategies

1. **Temperature Setting**: Use temperature = 0.3 for more consistent, focused summaries
2. **Token Limitation**: Set max_tokens = 60 to enforce brevity
3. **Few-shot Learning**: Include 2-3 examples in the prompt for better results
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Measure summary quality using:
   - Brevity (word/token count)
   - Key point inclusion (manual review)
   - Professional tone (manual review)
5. **Iterative Refinement**: Collect examples of poor summaries and refine the prompt

## Implementation

```typescript
export async function summarizeReport(reportContent: string) {
  try {
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4",
      messages: [
        {
          role: "system",
          content: `You are an expert summarization assistant for a professional report management system. Your task is to create a concise 1-2 sentence summary of the provided report content.

Guidelines:
1. Focus on the main topic and key findings/conclusions
2. Use professional, clear language
3. Maintain an objective tone
4. Avoid unnecessary details or examples
5. Keep the summary between 15-30 words
6. Do not use phrases like "this report" or "the author"
7. Use present tense for findings and conclusions

        },
        {
          role: "user",
          content: reportContent
        }
      ],
      temperature: 0.3,
      max_tokens: 60
    });
    
    return response.choices[0].message.content.trim();
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Error generating report summary:', error);
    return null;
  }
}
```
```
