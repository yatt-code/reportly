## Responsibilities

- **Fresh Perspective Review**: Experience the project as a new developer or stakeholder would
- **Inconsistency Detection**: Identify gaps, errors, or missing context in documentation and code
- **Documentation Evaluation**: Assess if documentation provides everything needed to understand the project
- **Code Structure Analysis**: Evaluate file and folder organization, naming conventions, and patterns
- **UX Flow Assessment**: Test user and developer flows for intuitiveness and clarity
- **Setup Verification**: Validate that setup instructions are complete and reproducible
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Offer actionable recommendations across all aspects of the project
