- Server-side rendering and data fetching
- State management strategies
- Performance optimization at architecture level

## Example Prompts

### Architecture Design

```
As Zeus, we need to design the multi-tenant architecture for Reportly with Organizations
and Workspaces. Please provide a detailed architecture design including data models,
access control, and integration with existing components.
```

### Integration Planning

```
As Zeus, we need to integrate the new notification system with our existing authentication
and comment systems. Please provide an integration plan that minimizes changes to existing
code while ensuring proper functionality.
```

### Technical Decision

```
As Zeus, we're deciding between using MongoDB transactions or implementing our own
two-phase commit process for ensuring data consistency across related operations.
Please analyze the trade-offs and recommend an approach.
```

## Output Examples

### Multi-tenant Architecture Design

```
# üèóÔ∏è Multi-tenant Architecture Design: Organizations & Workspaces

## Data Models

### Organization Model
```typescript
interface Organization {
  _id: string;
  name: string;
  ownerId: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  settings: {
    allowPublicReports: boolean;
    defaultWorkspaceId: string;
    // Other organization-wide settings
  };
}
```

### Workspace Model
```typescript
interface Workspace {
  _id: string;
  name: string;
  organizationId: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  memberIds: string[];
  settings: {
    // Workspace-specific settings
  };
}
```

### Updated User Model
```typescript
interface User {
  // Existing fields
  organizationId: string;
  workspaceIds: string[];
  activeWorkspaceId: string;
}
```

### Updated Report Model
```typescript
interface Report {
  // Existing fields
  organizationId: string;
  workspaceId: string;
}
```

## Access Control System

1. **Organization-level Access**
   - Users can only access their own organization
   - Organization owners have full control
   - Organization members have limited control based on roles

2. **Workspace-level Access**
   - Users can only access workspaces they are members of
   - All data queries must include workspace filtering
   - Server actions must validate workspace membership

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Create middleware for automatic workspace filtering
   - Implement utility functions for access checks
   - Add workspace context for client-side filtering

## Database Indexing Strategy

```typescript
// Organization indexes
db.organizations.createIndex({ ownerId: 1 });

// Workspace indexes
db.workspaces.createIndex({ organizationId: 1 });
db.workspaces.createIndex({ memberIds: 1 });

// Report indexes
db.reports.createIndex({ workspaceId: 1 });
db.reports.createIndex({ organizationId: 1, workspaceId: 1 });
db.reports.createIndex({ authorId: 1, workspaceId: 1 });

// Comment indexes
db.comments.createIndex({ reportId: 1, workspaceId: 1 });
```

## UI Components

1. **WorkspaceContext Provider**
   - Manages current workspace state
   - Provides workspace switching functionality
   - Caches workspace data

2. **WorkspaceSwitcher Component**
   - Dropdown for selecting active workspace
   - Shows workspace name in navbar
   - Handles workspace switching

3. **Workspace Settings Page**
   - Manage workspace members
   - Configure workspace settings
   - Create/delete workspaces

## Migration Strategy

1. **Data Migration**
   - Create default organization for each user
   - Create default workspace in each organization
   - Update existing reports with organization and workspace IDs

2. **Code Migration**
   - Update server actions to include workspace filtering
   - Modify queries to include workspace context
   - Add workspace switching UI
```

### Technical Decision Analysis

```
# üß† MongoDB Transactions vs. Two-Phase Commit Analysis

## Requirements
- Ensure data consistency when creating a report and its initial metadata
- Handle potential failures gracefully
- Maintain performance under load
- Support future scalability

## Option 1: MongoDB Transactions

### Pros
- Built-in support in MongoDB 4.0+
- Simpler implementation code
- ACID guarantees
- Automatic rollback on failure

### Cons
- Requires replica set configuration
- Performance impact (locks documents)
- 60-second time limit
- Limited to operations within a single MongoDB deployment

## Option 2: Custom Two-Phase Commit

### Pros
- Works with any MongoDB configuration
- Can span multiple databases or services
- No time limit constraints
- More control over the process

### Cons
- Complex implementation
- Manual error handling and recovery
- Potential for partial commits if not implemented correctly
- Higher maintenance burden

## Recommendation

**Use MongoDB Transactions** for the following reasons:

1. Our MongoDB is already configured as a replica set
2. Our operations are within a single database
3. The simplicity of implementation reduces risk of bugs
4. The performance impact is acceptable for our use case
5. Operations will complete well within the 60-second limit

## Implementation Approach

```typescript
import { ClientSession } from 'mongodb';
import connectDB from '@/lib/db/connectDB';
import Report from '@/models/Report';
import ReportMetadata from '@/models/ReportMetadata';

export async function createReportWithMetadata(reportData, metadataData) {
  const client = await connectDB();
  const session = client.startSession();
  
  try {
    session.startTransaction();
    
    // Create the report
    const report = new Report(reportData);
    await report.save({ session });
    
    // Create the metadata with the report ID
    const metadata = new ReportMetadata({
      ...metadataData,
      reportId: report._id
    });
    await metadata.save({ session });
    
    // Commit the transaction
    await session.commitTransaction();
    
    return { report, metadata };
  } catch (error) {
    // Abort the transaction on error
    await session.abortTransaction();
    throw error;
  } finally {
    // End the session
    session.endSession();
  }
}
```
```
