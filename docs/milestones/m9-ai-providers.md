# 🧭 Milestone 9: Multiple AI Providers

## Overview

This milestone focuses on expanding Reportly's AI capabilities by integrating multiple AI providers, starting with OpenRouter. This enhancement will give users access to a wider range of AI models beyond OpenAI, improving the quality, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of AI features throughout the application.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

1. Create a unified AI provider interface that abstracts provider-specific implementation details
2. Implement OpenRouter integration alongside existing OpenAI implementation
3. Create a flexible model selection system based on task requirements
4. Ensure backward compatibility with existing AI features
5. Provide comprehensive documentation and testing

## 📋 Feature Requirements

### Core Requirements

- **Provider Abstraction**: Create a unified interface for all AI interactions
- **Environment Configuration**: Support configuration via environment variables
- **Model Mapping**: Map between provider-specific model names
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for all providers
- **Metadata Tracking**: Track usage, costs, and performance metrics

### OpenRouter Integration

- **API Integration**: Implement OpenRouter API client
- **Model Selection**: Support OpenRouter-specific models
- **Authentication**: Secure API key management
- **Headers**: Implement required HTTP headers for OpenRouter

### Existing Feature Integration

- **Report Summarization**: Update to use the unified AI interface
- **Report Categorization**: Update to use the unified AI interface
- **Text Enhancement**: Update to use the unified AI interface
- **Suggestion Generation**: Update to use the unified AI interface

## 🛠️ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. Create unified AI client interface
2. Implement provider-specific API clients
3. Create model configuration and selection system
4. Update environment variables and configuration

### Phase 2: Feature Integration

1. Refactor existing AI features to use the unified interface
2. Test all features with both providers
3. Implement monitoring and logging

### Phase 3: Testing and Documentation

1. Create automated tests for the AI provider integration
2. Create manual test scripts for QA
3. Update documentation to reflect the new capabilities

## 📊 Success Metrics

- All AI features work correctly with both OpenAI and OpenRouter
- Switching between providers requires only environment variable changes
- No regression in existing AI feature functionality
- Comprehensive test coverage for the new integration

## 🔄 Dependencies

- OpenAI API integration (existing)
- Axios for HTTP requests
- Environment variable configuration

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test provider selection, model mapping, and error handling
- **Integration Tests**: Test each AI feature with both providers
- **Manual Tests**: Create comprehensive manual test scripts for QA

## 📝 Documentation Requirements

- Technical specification for AI providers
- Implementation details and changes summary
- Manual test scripts for QA
- Updated environment variable documentation

## 📅 Timeline

| Task | Duration | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Core Infrastructure | 1 week | Completed |
| Feature Integration | 1 week | Completed |
| Testing and Documentation | 1 week | In Progress |
| QA and Final Review | 1 week | Not Started |

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Add support for additional AI providers (e.g., Anthropic, Cohere)
- Implement automatic fallback between providers
- Create a provider performance comparison dashboard
- Implement cost optimization strategies
