# ðŸ“‹ ADR-004: TipTap for Rich Text Editing

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Reportly application requires a rich text editor for creating and editing reports. We needed an editor solution that would:

1. Provide a comprehensive set of formatting options
2. Support extensions for custom functionality
3. Integrate well with React and Next.js
4. Offer good performance and user experience
5. Support collaborative editing in the future
6. Allow for customization of the UI and behavior

## Decision

We decided to use TipTap as the rich text editor for the Reportly application.

## Rationale

TipTap provides several advantages that align with our project requirements:

1. **ProseMirror Foundation**: Built on the robust ProseMirror framework, providing a solid foundation for rich text editing.
2. **Extensibility**: Modular architecture with a wide range of extensions for additional functionality.
3. **React Integration**: First-class React support with React-specific components.
4. **Customizability**: Highly customizable UI and behavior.
5. **Collaborative Editing**: Support for collaborative editing through Y.js integration.
6. **Headless Design**: Separation of editor logic from UI, allowing for complete styling control.
7. **TypeScript Support**: Built with TypeScript for better type safety and developer experience.
8. **Active Development**: Actively maintained with regular updates and improvements.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Flexible and extensible editor framework
- High-quality editing experience
- Complete control over the editor UI
- Support for advanced features like collaborative editing
- Strong TypeScript integration
- Good performance characteristics

### Negative

- Steeper learning curve compared to simpler editors
- More complex configuration for advanced features
- Requires more custom styling compared to pre-styled editors
- Bundle size considerations with multiple extensions

## Alternatives Considered

### Draft.js

Draft.js is a React-specific rich text editor framework from Facebook, but it has less active development and more limited extension capabilities.

### Slate.js

Slate.js offers a flexible framework but with less maturity and fewer ready-made extensions compared to TipTap.

### CKEditor

CKEditor provides a full-featured editing experience but with less flexibility for customization and a more traditional UI approach.

### Quill

Quill is a popular editor with good performance, but it offers less extensibility and customization compared to TipTap.
