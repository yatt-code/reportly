# ðŸ“‹ ADR-006: AI Integration Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Reportly aims to enhance user productivity through AI-powered features. We needed to design an AI integration strategy that would:

1. Provide valuable AI assistance for report creation and editing
2. Support content analysis and categorization
3. Balance performance, cost, and user experience
4. Integrate well with our existing architecture
5. Allow for future expansion of AI capabilities

## Decision

We decided to implement a hybrid AI integration strategy with:

1. OpenAI's GPT models for content generation and analysis
2. Vector embeddings for content similarity and clustering
3. Server-side processing for most AI operations
4. Client-side integration for real-time assistance

## Rationale

This hybrid approach provides several advantages:

1. **Best-in-class Models**: OpenAI's GPT models provide state-of-the-art text generation and understanding.
2. **Flexible Integration**: Server-side processing allows for control over API usage and costs.
3. **Performance Balance**: Heavy processing on the server with lightweight client interactions.
4. **Vector Search**: Embeddings enable semantic search and content clustering.
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: AI features can be added incrementally without major architecture changes.
6. **Cost Control**: Server-side processing allows for rate limiting and usage monitoring.

## Consequences

### Positive

- High-quality AI assistance for users
- Flexible architecture for adding new AI features
- Control over API usage and costs
- Ability to cache and optimize AI responses
- Clear separation between UI and AI processing

### Negative

- Dependency on external AI services
- API costs that scale with usage
- Latency for server-processed AI operations
- Need for fallbacks when AI services are unavailable
- Complexity in managing AI request queues and rate limits

## Implementation Details

1. **AI Service Layer**:
   - Abstraction for different AI providers
   - Request queuing and rate limiting
   - Response caching and optimization
   - Error handling and fallbacks

2. **Integration Points**:
   - Editor suggestions and enhancements
   - Report summarization and categorization
   - Content clustering and recommendations
   - Search enhancement

3. **User Experience**:
   - Clear indication of AI-generated content
   - User control over AI assistance
   - Transparent processing indicators
   - Feedback mechanisms for AI quality

## Alternatives Considered

### Fully Client-side AI

Running AI models directly in the browser would reduce latency but would be limited by client capabilities and model size.

### Self-hosted Open Source Models

Self-hosting models like Llama would provide more control but with higher infrastructure costs and potentially lower quality.

### Single-vendor AI Solution

Using a comprehensive AI platform would simplify integration but could lead to vendor lock-in and less flexibility.
