# ðŸ“‹ ADR-001: Next.js App Router Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

When starting the Reportly project, we needed to choose a routing and rendering architecture for our Next.js application. The options were:

1. **Pages Router**: The traditional Next.js routing system
2. **App Router**: The newer, more feature-rich routing system introduced in Next.js 13+

The decision would impact our development approach, performance characteristics, and feature capabilities.

## Decision

We decided to use the Next.js App Router architecture for the Reportly application.

## Rationale

The App Router provides several advantages that align with our project requirements:

1. **Server Components**: Better performance and reduced client-side JavaScript
2. **Nested Layouts**: More flexible UI composition with shared layouts
3. **Server Actions**: Simplified data mutation without separate API routes
4. **Streaming**: Improved loading states and progressive rendering
5. **Parallel Routes**: Better support for complex UI patterns
6. **Intercepting Routes**: Enhanced modal and overlay support
7. **Future-Proof**: Alignment with the direction of Next.js development

## Consequences

### Positive

- Improved performance through server components
- Simplified data fetching and mutation
- More flexible layout composition
- Better loading state management
- Reduced client-side JavaScript

### Negative

- Steeper learning curve for developers new to App Router
- Some third-party libraries may not be fully compatible
- More complex mental model for component rendering
- Potential refactoring needed when upgrading Next.js versions

## Alternatives Considered

### Pages Router

The Pages Router is more established and has broader library support, but lacks the performance benefits and modern features of the App Router.

### Custom Routing Solution

Building a custom routing solution would give us more control but would require significant development effort and ongoing maintenance.
