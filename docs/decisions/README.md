# ðŸ“‹ Decision Records

This directory contains architectural decision records (ADRs) for the Reportly application. These documents capture important architectural decisions made during the development process, along with the context and consequences of those decisions.

## What is an ADR?

An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs are a lightweight way to document the key decisions that impact the architecture of a system.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a consistent format:

1. **Title**: A descriptive title in the format "ADR-NNN: Title"
2. **Status**: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
3. **Context**: The context and background in which the decision was made
4. **Decision**: The decision that was made
5. **Consequences**: The consequences of the decision, both positive and negative
6. **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were considered
7. **References**: Related documents or resources
