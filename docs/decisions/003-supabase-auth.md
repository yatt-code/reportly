# ðŸ“‹ ADR-003: Supabase for Authentication

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Authentication is a critical component of the Reportly application, requiring secure user management, session handling, and integration with our authorization system. We needed an authentication solution that would:

1. Provide secure user authentication
2. Support multiple authentication methods
3. Handle session management
4. Integrate well with our Next.js application
5. Offer good developer experience
6. Scale with our application

## Decision

We decided to use Supabase Authentication for user management and authentication in the Reportly application.

## Rationale

Supabase Authentication provides several advantages that align with our project requirements:

1. **Complete Auth Solution**: Supabase provides a full-featured authentication system with user management, session handling, and security features.
2. **Multiple Auth Methods**: Support for email/password, social logins, and magic links.
3. **Next.js Integration**: Official Next.js helpers and middleware for easy integration.
4. **JWT-Based**: Secure JWT-based authentication with configurable expiry.
5. **Row-Level Security**: Integration with PostgreSQL RLS for fine-grained access control.
6. **User Management API**: Comprehensive API for user operations.
7. **Self-Hosted Option**: Ability to self-host if needed in the future.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Reduced development time by using a pre-built auth solution
- Secure authentication with industry best practices
- Multiple authentication methods without additional development
- Good developer experience with Next.js integration
- Simplified user management

### Negative

- Dependency on an external service
- Limited customization compared to a fully custom solution
- Need to integrate with our MongoDB data models
- Potential vendor lock-in

## Alternatives Considered

### Custom Auth Solution

Building a custom authentication system would provide maximum flexibility but would require significant development effort and ongoing security maintenance.

### Auth0

Auth0 offers a robust authentication platform but with higher costs at scale and a more complex integration process.

### NextAuth.js

NextAuth.js is specifically designed for Next.js applications but has less comprehensive user management features compared to Supabase.

### Firebase Authentication

Firebase Authentication provides similar features but would introduce another service provider alongside our MongoDB database.
