#### Manual Test Script for UI Polish & Theming

**Prerequisites:**
- Access to the application on desktop and mobile devices (or using responsive mode in browser dev tools)
- Ability to navigate through different pages of the application

**Test 1: Theme Toggle Functionality**
1. Navigate to any page with the navbar visible
2. Locate the theme toggle button in the navbar (sun/moon icon)
3. Observe the current theme (light or dark)
4. Click the theme toggle button
5. Verify that:
   - The theme changes from light to dark or vice versa
   - All UI elements adapt to the new theme (text, backgrounds, buttons, etc.)
   - The theme toggle icon changes accordingly (sun to moon or vice versa)
   - The transition is smooth with subtle animations
6. Refresh the page
7. Verify that the selected theme persists after page reload

**Test 2: Responsive Layout**
1. Open the application on a desktop browser
2. Gradually resize the browser window from desktop to tablet to mobile sizes
3. Verify that:
   - The navbar adapts to different screen sizes (collapsing to a hamburger menu on mobile)
   - Touch targets remain large enough on mobile (at least 44px)
   - Text remains readable at all screen sizes
   - Spacing and margins adjust appropriately
   - No horizontal scrolling appears on any screen size
4. Test the mobile menu by clicking the hamburger icon
5. Verify that the menu opens and closes smoothly with animation

**Test 3: Loading States**
1. Navigate to a page that requires data loading (e.g., dashboard, report page)
2. Observe the loading state before the content appears
3. Verify that:
   - A branded loading spinner is displayed
   - The loading state is visually appealing and on-brand
   - The transition from loading to content is smooth

**Test 4: Error States**
1. Attempt to access a non-existent page (e.g., /non-existent-page)
2. Verify that:
   - A branded 404 page is displayed
   - The error page provides clear information about the error
   - Navigation options (e.g., go back, go home) are provided
   - The error page matches the current theme (light/dark)

**Test 5: Visual Consistency**
1. Navigate through different pages of the application
2. Verify that:
   - Colors, typography, and spacing are consistent across all pages
   - UI components (buttons, cards, inputs) have a consistent style
   - Animations and transitions are consistent in style and duration
   - Both light and dark themes are implemented consistently
