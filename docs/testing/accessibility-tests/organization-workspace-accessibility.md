## Test Execution

### Automated Testing

1. Run Axe or similar accessibility testing tools on each page
2. Run Lighthouse accessibility audit on each page
3. Validate HTML for proper semantic structure
4. Check color contrast using automated tools

### Manual Testing

1. Keyboard navigation testing
   - Tab through all interactive elements
   - Verify focus order is logical
   - Test keyboard shortcuts

2. Screen reader testing
   - Test with NVDA on Windows
   - Test with VoiceOver on macOS
   - Verify all content is announced correctly
   - Verify dynamic content updates are announced

3. Mobile accessibility testing
   - Test touch targets
   - Test responsiveness
   - Test with TalkBack on Android
   - Test with VoiceOver on iOS

## Reporting

The accessibility test report will include:

1. Executive summary
2. Detailed results for each test case
3. Screenshots and recordings of issues
4. Severity classification of issues
5. Recommendations for remediation
6. Retest results after fixes

## Accessibility Issues Classification

Issues will be classified by severity:

- **Critical**: Prevents users with disabilities from using core functionality
- **Major**: Significantly impairs usability for users with disabilities
- **Minor**: Causes some inconvenience but doesn't prevent task completion
- **Cosmetic**: Minor issues that have minimal impact on accessibility

## Remediation Plan

For each identified issue, the remediation plan will include:

1. Description of the issue
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Recommended fix
4. WCAG success criteria reference
5. Priority level
6. Assigned developer
7. Target completion date

## Conclusion

This accessibility test plan provides a comprehensive approach to evaluating the accessibility of the Organization & Workspace system. By executing these tests, we can ensure that the system is usable by all users, including those with disabilities, and meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
