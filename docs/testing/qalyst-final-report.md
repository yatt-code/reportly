# ‚úÖ QAlyst Full-System QA Report ‚Äì Reportly v1.0 (Updated: 2025-04-11)


## üêõ Test Failures and Errors

**Build Failures (NEW - Critical):**
- **`src/lib/auth.ts`:** Fails build due to importing server-only `cookies()` from `next/headers` into a module used by Client Components (`RegisterForm.tsx`). Requires separation of server/client helpers.
- **`src/app/settings/layout.tsx`:** Fails build due to using client-only `usePathname` hook in a Server Component layout. Requires `'use client';` directive or refactoring.

**Test Suite Failures (20 Suites Failed, 50 Tests Failed):**

### Module Import / ESM Issues (Persistent)
- **`ReportPageContainer.test.tsx`:** `SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'` (likely `lowlight` ESM issue).
- **`MermaidExtension.test.ts`:** `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` (likely `mermaid` ESM issue).
- **Root Cause:** Jest configuration (`transformIgnorePatterns`) likely needs adjustment to correctly process ESM dependencies in `node_modules`.

### Mocking & Initialization Issues (Persistent & New)
- **`addXp.test.ts`:** `supabase.from(...).update(...).eq is not a function` (Incorrect Supabase mock).
- **`ai-providers.test.js` (Integration):** Still likely failing due to missing API key mocks (not explicitly shown in latest run but previously reported).
- **`ai-providers.test.js` (Unit):** Previous report indicated incorrect mock responses and error handling issues.
- **`users-in-group/route.test.ts`:** `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'MockNextRequest' before initialization`.
- **`saveReport.test.js`:** `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'mockFindByIdAndUpdate' before initialization`.
- **`deleteComment.test.ts` / `postComment.mentions.test.ts`:** `ReferenceError: Request is not defined` (Missing Next.js server context mocks).
- **`MentionInput.test.tsx` (NEW):** Multiple failures related to `global.fetch` not being called as expected, indicating issues with the `fetch` mock or component interaction within the test.

### Component Test Logic Issues (Persistent)
- **`organization/page.test.tsx`:** `TestingLibraryElementError` (Unable to find expected element, potentially due to async state/loading issues in test).

**Linting Issues (NEW):**
- **`react/no-unescaped-entities`:** Errors in `not-found.tsx`, `workspaces/page.tsx`, `AiSuggestionPanel.tsx`, `LoginForm.tsx`, `ReportListItem.tsx`, `NotificationItem.tsx`, `LevelUpToast.tsx`. Needs HTML entity replacements (`&apos;`, `"`).
- **`@next/next/no-img-element`:** Warning in `CommentItem.tsx`. Recommend using `<Image>`.
- **`react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`:** Warning in `WorkspaceContext.tsx`. Needs dependency array review.

## üîß Setup and Configuration Issues

- **Build Errors:** The two critical build errors related to server/client module imports prevent creating a production build.
- **Jest Configuration:**
    - Needs update for ESM handling (`transformIgnorePatterns`).
    - Needs separate configurations or environment setup for Node.js (Mongoose tests) vs. JSDOM (React component tests).
- **Test Environment Variables:** No dedicated `.env.test` or consistent mocking strategy observed. AI tests still likely require mocked keys.
- **Mongoose Warnings:** Persist due to running Mongoose tests in `jsdom`.

## üîê Security and Access Control

- RBAC utilities (`useUserRole`, `hasRole`, `enforceRole`) are implemented.
- Server actions (`deleteReport`, `saveReport`, `getReportById`, `duplicateReport`, `getReportsByUser`) include ownership/role checks.
- Middleware (`middleware.ts`) implements basic route protection (redirecting unauthenticated users from protected routes, authenticated users from public auth routes).
- `postComment` uses service role key correctly for notification insertion.
- **Assessment:** Core RBAC and ownership logic seems implemented server-side, but **cannot be fully validated** due to failing tests and build issues. No obvious *new* vulnerabilities identified in the reviewed code.

## üöÄ Core Functionality Assessment

- **Authentication Flow:** Implemented (Login/Register pages, forms, context, middleware). *Confidence: Medium (Blocked by build errors, tests failing).*
- **AI Suggestion System:** Core components exist (`AiSuggestionPanel`, `MentionInput`, actions). Provider switching logic exists. *Confidence: Low (Blocked by build errors, AI tests failing).*
- **Report Creation/Editing:** Core components (`TipTapEditor`, `ReportPageContainer`) and actions exist. Ownership integrated. *Confidence: Medium (Blocked by build errors, component tests failing).*
- **Workspace Management:** Code exists, but tests are failing/unverified. *Confidence: Low.*
- **Gamification:** Core logic exists, integrated into `postComment`. User model inconsistency fixed. *Confidence: Low (XP tests failing, streak logic is placeholder).*
- **Notification System:** Backend actions and frontend components implemented, context provider set up. *Confidence: Medium (Tests failing/missing).*
- **Commenting/Mentions:** Core system implemented. Mention parsing/rendering done. *Confidence: Medium (Server action tests failing).*
- **Dashboard:** UI components created, uses server-side fetch. Actions implemented. *Confidence: High (Relatively self-contained, relies on tested actions).*

## üìä Test Coverage Analysis

- **Current State:** Highly unreliable due to 20 failed suites and 50 failed tests out of 64 suites / 302 tests total. Build failures prevent accurate assessment.
- **Coverage:** Likely low to medium for core features, with significant gaps.
- **Missing/Inadequate Tests:** (As identified previously and still relevant)
    - Error Handling (Network, API limits, Timeouts)
    - Edge Cases (Large inputs, high values, concurrency)
    - Workspace Logic (Comprehensive tests needed)
    - Gamification (Streak logic, level-up)
    - Notifications (Real-time, error states)
    - Security/RBAC (Granular group/role checks)
    - E2E Flows (Signup -> Report -> Comment -> Mention -> Notify)
    - Manual Test Validation (Coverage unverified)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases and Error Handling

- Error handling exists in many actions/components (e.g., using `try...catch`, toast notifications).
- **Assessment:** Insufficiently tested. The failing tests and lack of specific error/edge case tests mean confidence in robustness is low. Missing tests for token limits, rate limiting, and concurrency remain critical gaps.

## ‚ú® Optimization Recommendations

*(Recommendations remain largely the same as the previous report due to unresolved core issues)*

### Test Improvements (Highest Priority)
1.  **Fix Build Errors:** Address the server/client import issues in `lib/auth.ts` and `app/settings/layout.tsx`.
2.  **Fix Jest Configuration:** Correctly configure `transformIgnorePatterns` for ESM dependencies (`lowlight`, `mermaid`, etc.). Set up distinct test environments for Node.js (backend actions, DB models) and JSDOM (React components).
3.  **Improve Test Mocks:** Implement robust and correct mocks for Supabase (especially chained methods), Next.js server context (`Request`), `fetch`, and environment variables (`.env.test`). Remove reliance on actual API keys.
4.  **Fix Test Logic:** Address initialization order errors and component state/async issues in failing tests.
5.  **Add Missing Tests:** Prioritize error handling, edge cases, and core E2E flows once the suite is stable.

### Code Improvements (Lower Priority - Post-Test Fixes)
1.  **Gamification:** Implement actual streak calculation logic. Improve XP system error handling/retry logic.
2.  **AI Providers:** Implement caching, provider fallback, and better rate limit handling.
3.  **Performance:** Optimize DB queries (especially for stats/achievements), consider lazy loading.
4.  **Refactoring:** Separate server/client concerns in `lib/auth.ts`.

## üèÅ Final Verdict

System stability: ‚ùå (Critical build errors, numerous test failures)
Ready for audit: ‚ùå (Significant testing and build issues must be resolved first)

**Reasoning:** The project remains **unstable** and **not ready for audit**. Critical build errors prevent deployment and indicate fundamental issues with server/client code separation. The test suite is largely broken due to configuration and mocking problems, making it impossible to verify the reliability of implemented features. Fixing the build errors and stabilizing the test suite are essential prerequisites before any further QA or audit can be meaningful.

## üìù Additional Notes

- **Priority:** Build errors > Jest config > Mocking > Test logic > Linting > New tests.
- **Manual Testing:** Cannot be reliably performed until the application builds and runs (`npm run dev`).
- **Documentation:** Test environment setup and known issues need clear documentation.

### Debugging Attempts & Persistent Blockers (2025-04-11)

Several attempts were made to resolve the widespread test failures, focusing on the most likely root causes:

1.  **Build Errors (`src/lib/auth.ts`, `src/app/settings/layout.tsx`):**
    *   **Action:** Separated server-only `getCurrentUser` into `auth.server.ts` and updated all imports. Added `'use client'` to `settings/layout.tsx`.
    *   **Outcome:** These specific build errors *should* be resolved, but couldn't be confirmed due to persistent test failures preventing a clean build check.

2.  **Jest Configuration - ESM Handling (`jest.config.js`):**
    *   **Action 1:** Modified `transformIgnorePatterns` to explicitly list known ESM dependencies (`lowlight`, `mermaid`, `@supabase/ssr`, etc.) within a negative lookahead.
    *   **Outcome 1:** Test run still showed ESM `SyntaxError` for `lowlight` and `mermaid`.
    *   **Action 2:** Refined `transformIgnorePatterns` using a slightly different common pattern.
    *   **Outcome 2:** Test run still showed the same ESM `SyntaxError` failures. ESM transformation remains a **blocker**. Further investigation into `ts-jest`/`babel` configuration or specific module transforms is needed.

3.  **Jest Configuration - Path Aliases (`jest.config.js`):**
    *   **Action 1:** Ensured `moduleNameMapper` and `moduleDirectories` were correctly set.
    *   **Outcome 1:** Tests still failed with "Cannot find module" errors for `@/` aliases.
    *   **Action 2:** Cleared Jest cache (`npm test -- --clearCache`).
    *   **Outcome 2:** "Cannot find module" errors persisted after cache clear.
    *   **Action 3:** Explicitly configured `ts-jest` globals in `jest.config.js` to use `tsconfig.json` paths.
    *   **Outcome 3:** "Cannot find module" errors **were resolved** in the subsequent test run. Path alias configuration appears correct now.

4.  **Mocking - `getCurrentUser` (`tests/setup.js`, various test files):**
    *   **Action 1:** Implemented a global mock for `getCurrentUser` (returning `null` by default) in `tests/setup.js`. Configured Jest to use this setup file. Removed local mocks from individual test files. Imported `getCurrentUser` into tests needing to override the mock (e.g., `getOrganization.test.ts`).
    *   **Outcome 1:** Test failures related to "Authentication required." being returned unexpectedly in multiple action tests (e.g., `getOrganization`, `createWorkspace`) were **resolved**, indicating the global mock and override strategy is working. However, `AdminUsersPage.test.tsx` still failed on `user!.id`, suggesting its specific mock override might be incorrect.

5.  **Mocking - Initialization Order (`saveReport.test.js`, `users-in-group/route.test.ts`):**
    *   **Action:** Reordered mock variable definitions to occur before their use within `jest.mock` factory functions.
    *   **Outcome:** Initialization errors for `mockFindByIdAndUpdate` and `MockNextRequest` **were resolved**.

6.  **Mocking - `Request is not defined` / `TextEncoder is not defined`:**
    *   **Action:** Attempted to configure Jest projects in `jest.config.js` to use `testEnvironment: 'node'` for backend tests and `testEnvironment: 'jest-environment-jsdom'` for component tests. (Interrupted before completion/verification).
    *   **Outcome:** Inconclusive. This remains a likely solution but needs proper implementation and testing.

**Summary of Blockers:**
- **ESM Transformation:** Jest cannot correctly parse `lowlight` and `mermaid`. Requires further Jest/Babel/ts-jest configuration.
- **Server Context Mocking:** Tests for server actions fail (`Request is not defined`). Needs Node environment setup in Jest or better mocking.
- **Specific Test Failures:** Mocking issues remain for `addXp` (Supabase client), `MentionInput` (fetch), `MermaidDiagram` (mermaid lib). Test logic issues in `AdminUsersPage` and potentially others uncovered once ESM/mocking is fixed.
