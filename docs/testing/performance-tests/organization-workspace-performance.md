# Performance Test Plan: Organization & Workspace System

This document outlines the performance testing approach for the Organization & Workspace system in the Reportly application.

## Objectives

- Evaluate the performance of workspace switching with varying numbers of workspaces
- Measure the load time of reports and comments within workspaces of different sizes
- Identify performance bottlenecks in the multi-tenant architecture
- Establish performance baselines for future comparison

## Test Environment

- **Testing Tools**: JMeter, Lighthouse, React Profiler
- **Environment**: Staging environment with production-like data
- **Monitoring**: Server CPU, memory, database queries, network latency

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Workspace Switching Performance

**Objective**: Measure the performance of switching between workspaces with different numbers of workspaces.

**Test Cases**:
- TC1.1: Switch between workspaces with a user having 5 workspaces
- TC1.2: Switch between workspaces with a user having 20 workspaces
- TC1.3: Switch between workspaces with a user having 50 workspaces
- TC1.4: Switch between workspaces with a user having 100 workspaces

**Metrics**:
- Time to load workspace data
- Time to update UI after workspace switch
- Number of API calls made
- Size of data transferred

**Success Criteria**:
- Workspace switching should complete in under 500ms for up to 20 workspaces
- Workspace switching should complete in under 1000ms for up to 50 workspaces
- Workspace switching should complete in under 2000ms for up to 100 workspaces

### 2. Report Loading Performance

**Objective**: Measure the performance of loading reports within workspaces of different sizes.

**Test Cases**:
- TC2.1: Load reports in a workspace with 10 reports
- TC2.2: Load reports in a workspace with 50 reports
- TC2.3: Load reports in a workspace with 100 reports
- TC2.4: Load reports in a workspace with 500 reports
- TC2.5: Load reports in a workspace with 1000 reports

**Metrics**:
- Time to first byte (TTFB)
- Time to interactive (TTI)
- First contentful paint (FCP)
- Number of database queries
- Query execution time

**Success Criteria**:
- Reports list should load in under 1000ms for up to 100 reports
- Reports list should load in under 2000ms for up to 500 reports
- Reports list should load in under 3000ms for up to 1000 reports
- Pagination should be implemented for workspaces with more than 50 reports

### 3. Comment Loading Performance

**Objective**: Measure the performance of loading comments within reports in different workspaces.

**Test Cases**:
- TC3.1: Load comments for a report with 10 comments
- TC3.2: Load comments for a report with 50 comments
- TC3.3: Load comments for a report with 100 comments
- TC3.4: Load comments for a report with 500 comments

**Metrics**:
- Time to load comments
- Time to render comments
- Number of database queries
- Query execution time

**Success Criteria**:
- Comments should load in under 500ms for up to 50 comments
- Comments should load in under 1000ms for up to 100 comments
- Comments should load in under 2000ms for up to 500 comments
- Pagination should be implemented for reports with more than 50 comments

### 4. Organization Management Performance

**Objective**: Measure the performance of organization management operations.

**Test Cases**:
- TC4.1: Create a new organization
- TC4.2: Update an organization
- TC4.3: Load organization details with 10 members
- TC4.4: Load organization details with 50 members
- TC4.5: Load organization details with 100 members

**Metrics**:
- Operation completion time
- Database query execution time
- Server response time

**Success Criteria**:
- Organization creation should complete in under 1000ms
- Organization update should complete in under 500ms
- Organization details should load in under 1000ms for up to 100 members

### 5. Concurrent User Testing

**Objective**: Measure the performance of the system under concurrent user load.

**Test Cases**:
- TC5.1: 10 concurrent users switching workspaces
- TC5.2: 50 concurrent users switching workspaces
- TC5.3: 100 concurrent users switching workspaces
- TC5.4: 10 concurrent users loading reports in different workspaces
- TC5.5: 50 concurrent users loading reports in different workspaces
- TC5.6: 100 concurrent users loading reports in different workspaces

**Metrics**:
- Server response time
- Database query execution time
- CPU and memory usage
- Error rate

**Success Criteria**:
- System should maintain response times within 20% of baseline with up to 50 concurrent users
- System should maintain response times within 50% of baseline with up to 100 concurrent users
- Error rate should be less than 1% under all load conditions

## Test Execution

### Test Data Preparation

1. Create test organizations with varying numbers of workspaces
2. Create test workspaces with varying numbers of reports
3. Create test reports with varying numbers of comments
4. Create test users with varying levels of access

### Test Execution Steps

1. Set up monitoring tools to capture performance metrics
2. Execute each test case with the specified parameters
3. Capture all relevant metrics
4. Analyze results against success criteria
5. Identify performance bottlenecks
6. Repeat tests after optimizations

## Reporting

The performance test report will include:

1. Executive summary
2. Detailed results for each test case
3. Comparison against success criteria
4. Identified bottlenecks
5. Recommendations for optimization
6. Baseline metrics for future comparison

## Optimization Strategies

If performance issues are identified, consider the following optimization strategies:

1. Implement pagination for large data sets
2. Add caching for frequently accessed data
3. Optimize database queries and indexes
4. Implement lazy loading for workspace data
5. Use server-side rendering for initial page load
6. Optimize React component rendering
7. Implement data prefetching for common navigation paths

## Conclusion

This performance test plan provides a comprehensive approach to evaluating the performance of the Organization & Workspace system. By executing these tests, we can identify potential performance issues before they impact users and establish baselines for ongoing performance monitoring.
