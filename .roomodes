Critical Issues\n- [CRITICAL] Insecure authentication in `pages/api/auth.ts:line 45`\n  - Issue: Plaintext password transmission\n  - Fix: Implement HTTPS and use bcrypt for password hashing\n\n### 2. High Priority Optimizations\n- [HIGH] Performance bottleneck in `components/DataGrid.tsx`\n  - Issue: Unnecessary re-renders on data updates\n  - Optimization: Implement React.memo and useMemo for expensive calculations\n\n### 3. Medium Priority Improvements\n- [MEDIUM] Incomplete error handling in `lib/api/fetchData.ts`\n  - Suggestion: Add try/catch blocks and implement a global error boundary\n\n### 4. Low Priority Enhancements\n- [LOW] Missing alt text on images in `pages/about.tsx`\n  - Improvement: Add descriptive alt text for better accessibility",
